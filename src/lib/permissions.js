/* The capability catalogue and the live role table.

   CAPABILITIES are code: each label below is named in a
   requirePermission() call on a real route (see routes/customers.js),
   so this list can only grow when someone writes the enforcement to go
   with it. Nothing in the UI can add to it.

   ROLES are data: which roles exist, and what level each one holds
   against each capability, lives in the Role collection and is managed
   from User management. PERMS below is only the seed used to create
   those rows the first time the app runs — after that the database is
   the truth and this matrix is history. lib/roleStore.js owns loading
   it into the cache this module reads. */

     already reach the day this list was added (derived from the
     action rows above, e.g. Trigger calendar mirrors Engagement data),

     page's access independently editable going forward instead of
     several pages moving together because they happened to share one
     action capability. See constants/navigation.js's `capability`
